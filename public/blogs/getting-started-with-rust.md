# Getting Started with Rust

**Published:** November 2025

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. In this post, I'll share my experience learning Rust and building this portfolio website with it.

## Why Rust?

Rust offers several compelling advantages:

1. **Memory Safety**: Without garbage collection, Rust prevents common memory errors at compile time
2. **Performance**: Rust code runs at C/C++ speeds
3. **Concurrency**: Built-in support for safe concurrent programming
4. **Modern Tooling**: Excellent package manager (Cargo) and tooling ecosystem

## Building This Website

This portfolio website is built entirely in Rust, using a custom HTTP server. The server handles:

- Static file serving
- API endpoints for the chat feature
- Markdown rendering for blog posts

## Key Learnings

Working with Rust has taught me:

- The importance of ownership and borrowing
- How to work with `Result` types for error handling
- The power of pattern matching
- Building efficient web servers without heavy frameworks

## Conclusion

Rust is a fantastic language for systems programming, and I'm excited to continue exploring its capabilities. If you're interested in learning Rust, I highly recommend the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
